# Scss Dev Template

This is a template using the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) adding a basic gruntfile necessary for easy Frontend Development and file structure.
It is based on Hugo Giraudels Sass [Boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate).
Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Be sure to browse the repository to see how it works.

## Getting Started

### Get the gruntfile to work

To run the grunt tasks you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and grunt installed.

Then head into the root directory and run  

```
npm install
```
